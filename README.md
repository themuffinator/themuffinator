## 🧃 About Me (Vibes First, Questions Later)

I vibe in the kitchen.  
I vibe while walking the dog.  
I vibe in the shower.  
I vibe on the loo.  
I have vibed in places that should not legally allow vibing.

Once upon a time I was grinding C++ like a medieval peasant sharpening a sword made of compiler errors.  
Then AI changed the game and I evolved into the **VibeMaster 5000**: now I ship ideas at reckless velocity and use "scope" as a suggestion.

## 🚀 Main Quake Crimes (The Fun Kind)

### 🥊 MuffMode (Quake II Rerelease)
The one and only competitive mod: **MuffMode**.  
If you like tight fights, big brain plays, and "how did that hit me?!" moments, you are home.

### 🔥 WORR! (Quake II Rerelease - Code Replacement)
**WORR!** is a full code replacement for Quake II Rerelease with extensive and exciting new features.  
More options. More tech. More "what if we just..." energy than is medically recommended.

### 🛠 Tooling Lab
Multiple dev tools in progress because I cannot leave workflows alone.  
If it can be automated, it will be automated. If it cannot, it will be bullied until it can.

### 🧟 Quake 4 Engine Replacement (Nearly Complete)
A Quake 4 engine replacement thats nearing completion.  
The goal: modernize, stabilize, and extend without begging 2005 for permission.

## 📜 Limerick (Legally Required Nonsense)

There once was a dev full of spunk,  
Who vibed in the bath and the bunk.  
With Quake on his mind,  
He left bugs far behind,  
And shipped while the critics just clunk.

## 🧪 Development Philosophy (Unhinged But Strangely Effective)

- If it compiles, its a suggestion.
- If it runs, its a feature.
- If it crashes, its a "dynamic surprise event."
- If it works on my machine, your machine is clearly haunted.
- If it works on your machine too, we have achieved enlightenment (or summoned a demon).

## 🧙 Summon Me (Ritual Instructions)

Open an issue with:
- a wild idea 🧠
- a cursed bug 🐛
- a screenshot of something illegal 🔥
- or the words: **"what if we made it Quake but more unhinged"**

I will arrive vibrating slightly, with a plan and three alternate plans (all of them questionable).
